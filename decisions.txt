Approach:
- Find a pre-trained model
- Use that to classify document contents based on labels


Choice of approach:
- Zero-shot classification
  - Chosen because it allows a more straightforward implementation
  - Allows for dynamic labelling, allowing scaling to other industries, at the cost of lower accuracy and no opportunity to fine-tune
